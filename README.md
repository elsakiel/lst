# Scrum-nanny
to keep your sprint commitment safe

## What is it?
Scrum-nanny is a command line utility to create sprint burnup/down charts out of Jira/Zebra data. Just edit a json config file so that it's knows what project you're currently working on, and enjoy a nice up-to-date chart.

## Advantages
* team knows how the sprint is going on
* PO knows how the sprint is going on
* easy installation (Python is your friend)
* easy setup (aka _no_ setup)
* easy configuration (edit a json file)
* coming soon: even easier configuration (through interactive questions)

## Installation
grab the source and run `python setup.py install`
copy the secret_dis.json file to secret.json and change your jira/zebra credentials
edit settings.json file (see below)
coming soon

## Settings
coming soon

## Commands
### Fetch data and display a chart (default)
`scrum_nanny my-project-name`
Could it be easier?
